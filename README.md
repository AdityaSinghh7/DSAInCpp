# DSAInC++

<h2>  This repository is part of a series exploring various data structures in C++. </h2>

<b> 1. </b> <p> The first project develops a String class, enhancing C-style strings with dynamic memory management and easy-to-use functionalities. This project serves as a foundation for mastering dynamic allocation and class encapsulation in C++. </p>

<b> 2. </b> <p>C++ implementations of UnorderedArrayList and UnorderedLinkedList, derived from an abstract base class UnorderedList. It includes performance measurement functionalities using the Timer class, which provides precise timing for wall-clock, user CPU, and system CPU times. These tools are essential for benchmarking and comparing the efficiency of different list operations in a simple, modular codebase suitable for educational and development purposes.</p>

<b> 3. </b> <p> C++ implementations of sorted list data structures, specifically tailored to showcase efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Accompanied by the Timer utility class defined in Timer.h, the repository offers tools to precisely measure performance metrics across these operations. The main.cpp and sorted_lists.cpp files contain the core functionality and benchmarks, respectively, making this a comprehensive toolkit for educational and performance evaluation purposes in data structure development.</p>

<b> 4. </b> <p> This repository features C++ implementations of fundamental data structures including Linked Stacks, Linked Queues, Array Stacks, and Array Queues. The code demonstrates efficient operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue across different structure types. Performance measurements are facilitated by the Timer.h utility, providing precise timing of operations. main.cpp integrates these structures in practical scenarios, serving both educational and benchmarking purposes.</p>
