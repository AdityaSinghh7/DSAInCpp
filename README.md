# DSAInC++

<h2>  This repository is part of a series exploring various data structures in C++. </h2>

<b> 1. </b> <p> The first project develops a String class, enhancing C-style strings with dynamic memory management and easy-to-use functionalities. This project serves as a foundation for mastering dynamic allocation and class encapsulation in C++. </p>

<b> 2. </b> <p>C++ implementations of UnorderedArrayList and UnorderedLinkedList, derived from an abstract base class UnorderedList. It includes performance measurement functionalities using the Timer class, which provides precise timing for wall-clock, user CPU, and system CPU times. These tools are essential for benchmarking and comparing the efficiency of different list operations in a simple, modular codebase suitable for educational and development purposes.</p>
